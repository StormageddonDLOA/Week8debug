# Week 8 Assignment

Fix the bugs according to the following scenario: A user reported the following problems with the application when the following input was entered: Name = Nokia; Description = 3310; Price = 100; (don't include the semicolons, I'm using them as delimiters here)
1. There is a problem with the calculation of the royalties based on item name. $10 should be included if the item's name is nokia - 2 pts
2. There is a problem with the calculation of the royalties based on the description. $5.50 should be added if the description has 3310 in it.&nbsp;- 2pts
3. There is a problem with the calculation of the royalties based on the price. If it's between $50 and $100 then we should add $30 to the royalty.- 2pts
4. There is a problem with the royalty if the item's name is nokia and the description is 3310&nbsp;- 2pts
5. We should add a 5% tax if the royalty is greater than $1.00&nbsp;- 2pts
The expected royalty amount is $57.50 for the above input.
